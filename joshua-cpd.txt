Reflection
// Your reflection goes here
In today session I learnt that the Web Development industry is a rewarding, lucrative and creative industry to get into.
I also introduce myself to a class of strangers, this was initial a hard thing for me to undertake, but, as I heard other stories,
I began to realise that it was a good thing, and I feel that I had a break through with my confidence.
The part that I enjoyed the most was finding out what a web developer actually does, and the different roles that there are,
for instance, I did not realise that the is someone responsible for how a website looks and feels: frontend developer, and someone
responsible for the things that you don't see: Backend developer.
